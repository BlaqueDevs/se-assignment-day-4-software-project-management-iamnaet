Hypothetical Software Project: A Mobile App for Sustainable Farming

8. Core Issues:

Lack of Access to Agricultural Information: Farmers, especially in rural areas, often struggle to access up-to-date information on best practices, weather forecasts, and market prices.
Inefficient Resource Management: Inefficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides can lead to decreased yields and environmental damage.
Limited Market Access: Farmers may have difficulty finding buyers for their produce, especially in remote areas.
Significance:

These issues can significantly impact the livelihoods of farmers and contribute to food insecurity and environmental degradation. Addressing these problems can improve agricultural productivity, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable practices.

9. Clearly Defining the Problem:

Targeted Solutions: A well-defined problem ensures that the software solution is focused and addresses the specific needs of farmers.
Prioritization: Helps identify the most critical features to implement.
Evaluation: Provides a framework for measuring the software's effectiveness.
